# Yoga-Nature
Is a website intended for audiences that are interested in learning body/mind self-improvement techniques through yoga. The title needed to coincide with how in tune yoga makes people feel with nature. I then needed to reflect that right away by having my ([Hero Image](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-blue-sea-1430677/)) present such an environment. The website is intended for public use so there is no need to **"pay"** a subscription in order to sign up for the courses. Considering the times we are living in where people are working remotely from home and keeping a distance provided a great oppotunity to teach yoga from the comfort of your mobile or laptop device. 



I have used the website ([Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)) for all the images on my website except the ones that I own myself which are of the 'yoga instructor' Emelie Sandberg. "Pexels" provides free stock photos and videos for public use. The images of Emelie Sandberg were taken by me personally and the demonstration videos were also recorded by me. I have full rights to use the images and videos from her for this project as she has allowed me. She is also an acrobatic artist who has her own website for bookings at

### The Landing Page Image 

* The landing page like I mentioned earlier needs to coincide with how yoga is connected to nature. I chose an image of a beach from (**[Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-blue-sea-1430677/)**). The colors brought a sense of relaxation and calmness.

## Colors

* I then had a color palette created on (**[coolors](https://coolors.co/)**). This was done by uploading the image and having it choose a palette which I can then adjust to my liking. This is the result I settled with in the end.
